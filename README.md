## The Time-Dependent Viscous Burgers Equation

burgers_time_viscous, a FENICS code which uses the finite element method to solve a version of the time-dependent viscous Burgers equation over the interval [-1,+1].

Note that I have installed FENICS using Docker, and so to run this script I issue the commands:

cd $HOME/fenicsproject/burgers_time_viscous
fenicsproject run
python3 burgers_time_viscous.py
exit
